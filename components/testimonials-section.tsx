The main thing of this course was it has vast number of topics included which is truly needed for upskilling. They also gave useful tips and tricks for Resume Building and how to crack the Technical Interview. They trained us with hands-on projects which is much better way to practice. Highly recommend to everyone who is new to the cybersecurity world! 👏",
